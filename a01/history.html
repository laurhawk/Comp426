            <h2>A Short Background</h2>
            <h3>Modern vampires, and their traits, are well-established in our culture,
                due to vampire novels, movies, and costumes. We know them to be pale,
                have a certain thirst for blood, be easily repelled with garlic, 
                and sleep in coffins. 
                Where did all of these myths come from, though? 
            </h3>
            <p>Scholars believe that vampire myths began in Europe, and their beliefs
                that the dead, after burial, could arise and harm the living. However,
                these myths were not isolated to just Europe; myths of satanic blood drinkers
                have been popular all over the world, for many centuries. Several of
                these legends arose from a misunderstanding of human decomposition. 
                "When a corpse's skin shrinks, its teeth and fingers can appear to have grown larger.
                And as internal organs break down, a dark 'purge fluid' can leak out of the 
                nose and mouth. People unfamiliar with this process would interpret
                this fluid to be blood and suspect that the corpse had been drinking it
                from the living," (Little).
                There were more misunderstandings; people during these times (*cough cough* plague times)
                also thought that diseases might be spread through vampires. They thought if they
                could kill vampires, they could potentially prevent the spread of disease. As a result,
                vampire scares coincided with plague outbreaks.

                However, even after the Black Death had come and gone from Europe on several occassions,
                vampire myths persisted, and even continued to be popular throughout the 17th and 18th 
                centuries. There were instances of 'vampire killings' up through the 19th century in both
                Europe and New England. Interestingly, the 19th century is when the vampire novel
                became a popular form. <i>The Vampyre</i> (1919, written in the famous contest between Mary Shelley, 
                Percy Bysshe Shelley, Lord Byron, and others) is where our modern vampire trope largely comes
                from. The vampire in this novel, loosely based on Lord Byron, is sophisticated, sexual, and 
                aristocratic, much like we know vampires to be today. These Byronic tropes continued into later
                novels, such as Bram Stoker's 1897 <i>Dracula</i>, which further introduced vampiric tropes, such as
                the ability to bite people and turn them into vampires, being repelled by religious symbols, and others.
                These ideas prevailed through the 20th and 21st centuries,
                into characters such as Ann Rice's Lestat or Stephenie Meyer's Edward Cullen.

                After the publication of these novels, vampire panics died down largely, replacing the scary
                monsters people had previously percieved with the fictitious Byronic figures we know today. 
                However, there were some strange resurgances, but nothing on the scale of the past. Regardless, 
                vampires continue to be a popular myth for everyone to enjoy, even if they aren't quite as terrifying
                as they once were to the public.
